# kafka-example

## Context

This repository contains my playground piece of code for Kafka Consumer, producer and Kafka Streams. 
It has not been designed as a reference, I am just pushing it to Github for safe keeping. 
Nonetheless, I would be glad if it could help anyone ;) 

## List of examples

### Java

* avro-stream - Simple Kafka Streams using Avro as input and ouput
* avro - Simple Kafka consumer and producer using Avro and schema registry
* generate-complex-avro - Simple example of producing messages with Avro
* join-stream - Kafka Streams - Simple join between two topics using DSL
* simple - just producing and consuming data to Kafka
* stream-processor-groupby - Kafka Streams - a simple example of performing stateful  aggregation with the processor API
* windows-groupby - Kafka Streams - Windows Group By by using the DSL interface

### C++

* Simple producer, nothing fancy here

### Python

* consume - simple consumer
* produce - simple producer
